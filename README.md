An android app that can upload to Backblaze's B2 cloud storage


I was tired of not being able to upload files to Backblaze using their official app. So I made a small app that does that.
The app adds itself to the share menu.
There is an APK \app\release.


Warning: This was hacked together in about 1.5 weeks, this includes the time to learn android development. 
It works on my device(TM).
